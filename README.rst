Rbit: Email that learns
=======================

This is a machine-learning based email local email client that learns from your
past behaviour.

This is rudimentary, but I am doing it mostly to *scratch an itch*: I want a
decent email client on Linux and did not find one.

Dependencies
------------

Just copy and paste the commands below to install all dependencies (you must
have ``pip`` installed, but you already did that, right?)::

    pip install sqlalchemy

    pip install six
